# ToDoList

**What's Left:**
- !! UNIT TESTS !!
- Documentation (readme and doc)
- Ensure tasks are unique (do not allow duplicate task names on same date for same user)
- DB Integrity:
  - Do not re-start DB on each application startup, if DB container is active, keep it as it
  - If DB container active, pick up active users
